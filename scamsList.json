    "Date": "09/05/2025",
    "Description": "The FMA has been made aware of several promoters of the XPro multi-level marketing scheme operating in New Zealand.&nbsp; XPro promotes the products of several \u2018partner\u2019 schemes: Shiiro Academy  B2Pay  and Homnifi. Each of these partner schemes offers financial products or services  but they are not authorised to provide these in New Zealand.&nbsp; None of XPro\u2019s partner schemes are members of an approved dispute resolution scheme. If an investor has a complaint about these schemes  they will not be able to seek resolution through a dispute resolution scheme.&nbsp; The FMA recommends caution when dealing with XPro  any XPro promoters  or any of these XPro partner schemes. Our specific concerns about each organisation are set out below. &nbsp; XPro XPro does not provide any financial products or services. Instead  it promotes the financial products and services offered by its partner organisations: Shiiro Academy  B2Pay and Homnifi.&nbsp; XPro is a multi-level marketing scheme. It sells subscriptions  which grant members access to XPro\u2019s \u201crewards program\u201d. Subscribers earn rewards by selling the products and services offered by XPro\u2019s partner organisations  and by recruiting new XPro members to sell those products and services.&nbsp; The FMA is concerned that XPro\u2019s partner organisations are providing financial products and services in New Zealand without the appropriate licence and without being registered on the Financial Service Providers Register (FSPR). Several of the partner organisations have also made misleading claims about their financial products and services. Shiiro Academy Shiiro Academy offers what it describes as \u201ctrading signals\u201d for foreign exchange derivatives  recommending specific trades to its members. This is regulated financial advice. Shiiro is not licensed to provide financial advice in New Zealand  and it is not registered on the FSPR. &nbsp; The FMA is also concerned about unsubstantiated and misleading statements which Shiiro has made about its investment returns. Shiiro has claimed that investors can \u201cGET RICH QUICK\u201d and \u201cEARN $10 000 OVERNIGHT\u201d using its services. These claims are unrealistic and are likely to mislead investors.&nbsp; Foreign exchange derivatives are very high-risk investments and investment in these products usually carries significant financial risk. Be wary of any derivatives advisers or coaches who claim that they can give you access to easy money or help you to get rich quick.&nbsp; B2Pay B2Pay offers cryptocurrency payment cards. B2Pay is not registered on the FSPR  and is not authorised to provide this service in New Zealand.&nbsp; Homnifi Homnifi provides a cryptocurrency wallet service  allowing members to store cryptocurrency and process deposits  withdrawals and transfers. Homnifi is not registered on the FSPR  and is not authorised to provide these wallet services in New Zealand.&nbsp; Report New Zealand XPro promoters to the FMA If you have been approached by individuals in New Zealand promoting XPro or any of its partner schemes  report them to the FMA.&nbsp; Make a complaint &nbsp; Platform",

    "Description": "We have received reports of a hijacked or compromised Facebook profile (\u201cLA Thompson\u201d or \u201cLAThompsons Music\u201d) being used in a cryptocurrency trading scam.&nbsp; A post made on this Facebook account  which impersonated a New Zealand musician  recommended \u201cStephanie Robert\u201d as a successful crypto trader and investment coach. This \u201cStephanie Robert\u201d then referred a New Zealand resident to the GlobalTradingNex trading platform. Attempts to withdraw funds or apparent trading profits were unsuccessful. We have identified multiple websites that are part of this scam and believe more may be connected. The scammer may also change the social media accounts or platforms being used to solicit victims.&nbsp; This warning will be updated as the FMA is made aware of further websites and social media accounts associated with the scam.&nbsp; We recommend extreme caution when dealing with any of the social media profiles  websites or platforms listed below.&nbsp; Before approaching any crypto trading platforms or exchange providers  always check the Financial Service Provider Register (FSPR) to see if they are registered to provide financial products and services to New Zealanders. See Financial Service Provider Register (FSPR)&nbsp; How scammers use social media platforms Posts on popular Facebook accounts may recommend traders or investment coaches such as \u201cStephanie Robert\u201d (see Picture 1.) &nbsp;These accounts have  however  been compromised or hijacked. Researching \u201cStephanie Robert\u201d shows a profile page on en.everybodywiki.com  (see Picture 2). &nbsp; \u201cStephanie\u201d appears to be friendly and knowledgeable about cryptocurrency trading. She helps victims open trading accounts and asks them to transfer a very small amount of cryptocurrency as a trial. After the trial trade  account balances appear to grow considerably. The trading appears simple  with full access to the trading platform/exchange via phone  with confidence gained from the initial trial. \u201cStephanie\u201d says current market trends may not last long  so further trades are made. Within hours  accounts show big profits  prompting victims to try and withdraw their money. They are then asked to pay \u201ccoaching fees\u201d and \u201cPIN set-up fees\u201d along with a \u201ccryptocurrency trading tax\u201d - all required before the trading platform/exchange will process withdrawals. Suspicions from victims are met with assurances and messages from the original \u201cmusician\u201d  who says the trading platform is genuine. Eventually  account balances fall to zero with no money paid out.&nbsp; The original \u201cStephanie\u201d can no longer be contacted  with her social media profiles gone.&nbsp; The website hosting the trading platform is also gone - now rebranded and moved to another website/platform. What to do if you think you have been scammed Stop all contact with the scammer and do not send any money.&nbsp; Contact your bank or cryptocurrency exchange immediately  if they assisted you transfer funds. Ask whether a transaction reversal is possible. If you sent money using another payment service provider or cryptocurrency exchange  ask them to trace the funds.&nbsp; Tell a trusted relative or friend what has happened. They may help you see the situation more clearly  help you deal with the scammers  and suggest what to do next. Contact the FMA if the trading platform you encountered is not listed in this warning so we can update the warning. By reporting  you are helping protect others from falling for the same scam.

    "Description": "The FMA is aware of an investment scam using text messages  WhatsApp  and other social media platforms.&nbsp; The scammers often impersonate New Zealand banks  investment firms  and other financial service providers to persuade their victim to join an investment advice group chat. In this group chat  victims are encouraged to recruit friends and family members  and make payments to fraudulent investment platforms.&nbsp; We have identified multiple websites that are part of this scam but believe there may be more connected as they frequently change. This warning may be updated as the FMA is made aware of further websites (last updated 29 April 2025). &nbsp; The FMA reminds the public to be cautious when dealing with unsolicited messages about financial services  and always check the Financial Service Providers Register to see if an entity is registered to provide financial products and services to New Zealanders. See Financial Service Provider Register &nbsp; How the scam works:&nbsp; The scammer sets up a series of WhatsApp groups  these appear popular  but are mostly filled with bots.&nbsp; The scammers send bulk messages to potential new victims  inviting them to join the WhatsApp groups. In these messages  the scammers often falsely claim to be an employee of a New Zealand bank  investment firm  or other financial service provider.&nbsp; The WhatsApp group is led by a \u201cmentor  \u201ccoach\u201d \u201cprofessor\u201d  \u201cassistant\u201d or \u201ccrypto adviser\u201d. &nbsp; The scammer will promise 100% returns with \u201ctrading signals\u201d shared throughout the day. &nbsp; Users are encouraged to invite new recruits (often friends or family) and they receive rewards for each person they recruit.&nbsp; The groups may display a leaderboard and offer exclusive prizes such as cars for those that reach the top. We believe these leaderboards are fake and that you will not receive any of the prizes advertised. &nbsp; Users are instructed to open an account at a cryptocurrency exchange and load it with funds from their bank account. They are then instructed to transfer this cryptocurrency into a so-called \u201ctrading account\u201d. The scammer will introduce the user to an investment platform which comes highly recommended. The platforms have gone to great lengths to appear authentic by gaining overseas licences. The user will be able to make a few trades  so they believe the platform is authentic and encouraged to invest more funds. When the user asks to withdraw funds  they are told they must pay a significant fee to release the money. But even if these fees are paid  no money is returned.&nbsp; We recommend exercising extreme caution if you are invited to join these groups. If you receive an invitation from a friend or family member  please share our warning to keep them safe. What to do if you think you have been scammed Stop all contact with the scammer and do not send any money. Report the group to WhatsApp and block the scammer on all devices. &nbsp; If you are getting spam emails and text messages  report these to the Department of Internal Affairs here: Spam-Report-Spam - dia.govt.nz.&nbsp; Tell a trusted relative or friend what has happened.

    "Date": "16/04/2025",
    "Description": "The FMA has become aware of a large number of fake online investing platforms.&nbsp; Most offer investments in cryptocurrency  though some also offer derivatives or equity securities. These platforms are being used as part of a wider investment scam. The scammers contact potential investors through social media  encouraging them to invest money in the fake platforms. These platforms often make unrealistic promises about returns which investors can earn  promoting guaranteed returns which are too good to be true. When investors try to withdraw their funds  the platforms refuse to pay. They may ask for further payments to cover \u201ctaxes\u201d or \u201cwithdrawal fees\u201d  saying that the withdrawal will be processed once these extra payments are made. However  even if the investor pays the extra money  no funds are released. We recommend extreme caution when dealing with any of the websites/platforms listed below.&nbsp; We may update this warning as we are made aware of further websites  as the names frequently change (last updated 17 April 2025).

    "Name": "IPO websites - harvesting investor details",
    "Date": "28/03/2025",
    "Description": "The FMA is concerned about a number of IPO (Initial Public Offering) websites which claim to alert investors of upcoming share buying opportunities before they go public (Pre-IPO). Many of these websites refer to an upcoming IPO for the satellite internet company Starlink. We may continue to add further websites to this warning as we become aware of them. How the scam works These websites claim to help investors get early access to IPO investment opportunities. They may also claim to provide \u201ctop picks\u201d of upcoming IPOs  or market trends and insights. Site users are prompted to enter personal contact details and proposed investments into an online form. They are then told they will be emailed \u201calerts\u201d about new IPOs  or be called by a representative. Investors are then either convinced via email or telephone to invest  often being told that this is a \u2018limited opportunity\u2019  or that the price of shares will soon rise quickly.&nbsp; The investor will be asked to fill out application forms and provide identity documents such as a passport to open an account and satisfy relevant \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d requirements.&nbsp; The scammers email a Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) which does not meet the FMA\u2019s requirements for PDS \u2013 for more information on PDS scams see the article: How to identify a product disclosure statement (PDS) or prospectus scam. The investor will then be instructed to transfer their funds to a bank account or via cryptocurrency. Being asked to pay for shares via cryptocurrency is a red flag. Often the victim only becomes aware they are part of a scam when the news of the impending IPO is never announced  their broker stops answering emails or they try to withdraw their investment. &nbsp; For more information on IPO\u2019s and how they work see our article Spotlight on: IPOs.&nbsp; You can also read a real life case study of a New Zealander who narrowly avoided being scammed in a fake Starlink IPO investment: Starlink fraud case study. &nbsp; Contacts to be wary of",

We will continue to add further websites to this warning as we become aware of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; How the scam works These websites claim to compare investments  such as term deposit and bonds in New Zealand. They will often claim that returns are guaranteed  or funds are covered under a Depositor Compensation Scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp; Site users are prompted to enter their personal contact details and proposed investments into an online form. They are then told that someone will contact them with a personalised offer.&nbsp;&nbsp; A call then arrives from someone claiming to work for a financial institution or acting as a broker. They will present an investment offering returns which are often slighter higher than current market rates.&nbsp; The scammers email a Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) which does not meet the FMA\u2019s requirements for PDS \u2013 for more information on PDS scams see the article: How to identify a product disclosure statement (PDS) or prospectus scam The investor will be asked to fill out application forms and provide identity documents such as a passport to open an account and satisfy relevant \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp; The investor will then be instructed to transfer their investment to a bank account.

    "Date": "13/03/2025",
    "Description": "We are concerned that Ashbourne Wealth Management may be operating a scam. Ashbourne Wealth Management is a fake online investment platform  which tricks investors into laundering fraudulent funds. How the scam works Ashbourne Wealth Management posts advertisements on social media  encouraging victims to invest. The victim\u2019s small initial investment quickly grows to large profits. Ashbourne Wealth Management tells the victim they will need to pay a large upfront fee to withdraw their profits. When the victim is unable or unwilling to pay  Ashbourne Wealth Management offers to pay the fees for the victim. The victim receives funds into their bank account from a third party who is the victim of a recovery room scam. The victim is then instructed to forward the funds received to Ashbourne Wealth Management to pay for the withdrawal fees. The victim has unknowingly become a money mule for Ashbourne Wealth Management. We recommend caution when dealing with any person or entity that operates the same or similar ways described above. If a person or entity asks you to receive funds and instructs you to pay them on to a third party  exercise extreme caution. These are warning signs that the entity may be operating a money mule scam. Ashbourne Wealth Management is not registered to provide financial services in New Zealand. Always check whether a financial service provider is registered on the Financial Service Providers Register (FSPR) before accepting an offer of financial services.",

Bit Pro Gain says it is offering an online trading platform but is operating an investment scam.&nbsp; We have received a report from a New Zealand investor who created an account with Bit Pro Gain through the website bitprogain.io  and began with a small credit card payment to the platform. The investor says that Bit Pro Gain then took several unauthorised payments from the investor\u2019s bank account  totalling more than $250 000.&nbsp; Scam uses remote access software to access financial information When an investor creates a new account with Bit Pro Gain  they are prompted to install an app on their phone. Users are told the app will let them receive notifications about their investments. However  the app is a remote access application  which can grant Bit Pro Gain access to notifications and messages from the user\u2019s phone and other devices. Bit Pro Gain may be able to use this access to receive users\u2019 banking information or 2 factor authentication codes. Bit Pro Gain is operating through multiple websites We have concerns that bitpro-gain.com may be associated with the same investment scam  as the website offers similar services to bitprogain.io and uses the name Bit Pro-Gain. The website also displays a doctored version of a New Zealand Certificate of Incorporation.&nbsp; The Alberta Securities Commission has published a warning about the website bitprogain.com  which Bit Pro Gain has previously used to promote this scam. View the Alberta Securities Commission\u2019s warning about bitprogain.com This warning may be updated in future  if the FMA becomes aware of other Bit Pro Gain websites or contact channels. &nbsp;",

    "Description": "The FMA is aware of an investment scam which is using YouTube channels to promote fake crypto investment websites. The FMA reminds the public to always use the Financial Service Provider Register (FSPR) to check if a trading platform is registered to provide financial products and services to New Zealand. View the Financial Service Providers Register (FSPR) How the scam works The scammers post videos on YouTube or other social media platforms offering crypto \u201ctips\u201d and trading advice. These YouTube channels invite viewers to join private WhatsApp or Telegram groups for discussions on crypto investments. Prize offers and gifts are used to encourage viewers to join up. Scammers may also encourage viewers to comment on their videos. This can give the scammers access to viewers\u2019 contact details  which then lets the scammers approach viewers directly via WhatsApp or Telegram. Once the user has accepted a WhatsApp or Telegram invite  scammers present themselves as an investment \u2018expert\u2019  \u2018mentor\u2019 or \u2018coach\u2019  and start offering investment advice. The scammer will make unrealistic promises about these crypto investments  for example \u201cearn above $2000 - $7000 daily on crypto\u201d or \u201cavoid risks and generate profit... within three days\u201d. The scammer will introduce the user to a fake investment platform. These fake platforms may imitate well-known cryptocurrency exchanges. The scammer will then coach the user through investing. Often  they will first encourage their victim to invest a small amount of money. They are then told they\u2019ve earned big profits and encouraged to invest even more money. When the victim asks to withdraw their funds  they are told they must first pay a fee to release the money; even if these fees are paid  no money is paid out. If you come across these videos  or investment platforms like this  or you\u2019re added to unknown group chats  don\u2019t engage with them and don\u2019t give out any personal information or identity documents. View our warning about an earlier version of this scam  which used ads on social media platforms to link customers to WhatsApp groups. What to do if you think you have been scammed Stop all contact with the scammer and don\u2019t send any money. Report the videos to YouTube  report any advice&nbsp;groups to WhatsApp or Telegram  and block the scammer on all your devices. Contact your bank immediately. Ask if a transaction reversal is possible. If you sent money using another payment service provider  ask them to trace the funds. If you are getting spam emails and text messages  report these to the&nbsp;Department of Internal Affairs. Tell a trusted relative or friend what has happened. They may help you see the situation more clearly  help you deal with the scammers  and suggest what to do next. If you need emotional and practical support or information you can Contact Victim Support&nbsp;on 0800 842 846.",

We have seen similar scams in the past involving the use of well-known investment firms in the offer of fake bonds and other fixed term deposit products in the name of Heartland Bank  as well as a number of other New Zealand and overseas banks. Please see our past warnings about these scams: Heartland Bank - Fake term deposits and bonds HSBC - Fake term deposits Kiwibank - Comparison website harvesting investor details Rates Finder - Comparison website harvesting investor details How the scam works The victim sees an advertisement or visits an invest comparison website (like comparetermdepositsnz.com)  where they are prompted to enter their contact details. The victim receives a call from someone claiming to be an investment adviser from a well-known New Zealand firm. The \u2018investment adviser\u2019 will speak to the victim about an investment opportunity  usually with a well-known New Zealand bank or investment firm. The adviser may provide detailed but fraudulent investment documentation to the victim while attempting to persuade them to invest. Once the victim makes their investment  the scammer ceases contact  and the funds are lost. Website redirection service may also be used to redirect people to the official website of an organisation to mislead people into thinking that the scam website is legitimate. We recommend caution when dealing with people who claim to be from well-known investment management firms  especially after you enter your personal details in deposit comparison websites such as comparetermdepositsnz.com. Investors should conduct due diligence checks by contacting the investment firm or financial institution the caller claims to represent  to verify their identity before investing. Make sure you do not&nbsp;use the contact information provided by the caller. Instead  use the contact information listed on their official website.",

    "Description": "The FMA is aware of an investment scam currently circulating New Zealand involving multiple WhatsApp groups  websites and investment platforms. We may update this warning as we are made aware of further websites  as the names frequently change. Some of these websites may have obtained licenses from overseas authorities or appear to be endorsed by media articles which have been written and distributed by the investment platforms to provide credibility. The FMA reminds the public to always check the Financial Service Provider Register (FSPR) to see if an entity is registered to provide financial products and services to New Zealanders. Visit the Financial Service Provider Register (FSPR) How the scam works The scammer creates an ad on social media platform offering free education or tips on investment trading. Users are then prompted to join a WhatsApp group after clicking the ad. Alternatively  the scammer may add phone numbers directly to a WhatsApp group  without the user interacting with an ad first. The WhatsApp group is led by someone described as a \u201cmentor  \u201ccoach\u201d \u201cprofessor\u201d or \u201cassistant\u201d. The groups promise unrealistic returns such as turning $100k into $10m within 6-12 months  with their help. Gift cards  credit or free trades might be provided for attending sessions or completing educational training courses. The mentor will introduce and recommend an investment platform to the victim. Scammers have gone to great lengths to make these online platforms appear authentic. The investment platform will message users  helping them set up an account and make transfers. The user will then be able to make several trades  believing the platform to be authentic  which encourages them to invest more money. When the victim asks to withdraw funds  they are told they must first pay a fee to release the money; even if these fees are paid  no money is paid out. If you come across these ads or investment platforms  do not click on them and don't give them your personal information or identity documents. Learn more about Investment software packages and seminars What to do if you think you have been scammed Stop all contact with the scammer and do not send any money. Report the group to WhatsApp and block the scammer on all devices. Contact your bank immediately. Ask if a transaction reversal is possible. If you sent money using another payment service provider  ask them to trace the funds. If you are getting spam emails and text messages  report these to the Department of Internal Affairs. Tell a trusted relative or friend what has happened. They may help you see the situation more clearly  help you deal with the scammers  and suggest what to do next.

    "Name": "Deepfake video scam warning: fake news stories, political endorsements - multiple trading platforms",
    "Date": "06/08/2024",
    "Description": "The FMA has received several reports about a scam using fake endorsements supposedly coming from New Zealand politicians. Their names and images are being faked and misused to promote online investment schemes. This scam uses fake news stories  spread through multiple websites and advertisements  with the names of investment schemes and websites used to promote the scam changing frequently. Updated 29 April 2025 Further reports received show that the scammers use aggressive sales techniques to convince people to invest. We have issued another warning that includes two newly identified entities and a person involved in the scams. See the related warning: CapitalXTrade and Coyken Updated 9 October 2024 The FMA is aware that this scam is now using fake news articles featuring claims that New Zealanders will receive \u201cincome\u201d or \u201cdividend\u201d payments from IRD. The fake claims say that money will be sent to New Zealanders after they sign up with an online investment platform. These fake news articles include photographs of New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and other New Zealand politicians and feature headlines such as: \u201cBy the order of Christopher Luxon  New Zealand residents will start receiving income from taxes.\u201d Inland Revenue has confirmed these claims are false. There is no pool of tax funds becoming available for distribution to New Zealanders. How the scam works Scammers draw in victims through advertisements placed on social media platforms and news aggregators. There are several variations of these advertisements. Some ads: Show an image of a politician next to a fictional quote about a new investment opportunity e.g.  \"According to Christopher Luxon  all citizens of New Zealand can officially retire at the age of 45!\" Contain generic images  with a headline designed to promote fear about the stability of New Zealand pensions e.g.  \"PENSION PAYMENTS WILL BE CANCELLED IN THE NEW ZEALAND!\". Feature deepfake videos of politicians  including New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters. These fake videos show the politician being interviewed about a new investment opportunity which they have invested in personally  or which is claimed to be endorsed by the government. These advertisements link to fake news articles featuring false quotes and endorsements from politicians  usually promoting an investment platform. These articles are often made to appear as though they are being published by legitimate New Zealand media organisations. These fake news articles have links to other websites  advertising investment platforms or promoting educational materials about investments. The websites include registration forms  where potential victims are prompted to enter their contact details. Scammers will then contact the victim claiming to be an investment broker and give instructions for investing through the platform. Victims are encouraged to make a small investment at first (around US$250/NZ$420). Requests for larger investments will likely follow. &nbsp; Exercise caution The FMA recommends extreme caution when engaging with social media advertisements or links in news aggregators that include fake political endorsements promoting investment opportunities. Do not click on these ads or links  and do not enter your personal information into these websites. If you have been contacted by a scammer after entering your personal information into one of these websites  do not make any payments or transfer any money to the scammers. Related warning View Fake celebrity investment scam - multiple platforms What to do if you think you have been scammed? Contact your bank immediately. Ask if a transaction reversal is possible. If you sent money using another payments service provider  ask them to trace the funds. If you have downloaded remote access software on the instructions of the scammers  immediately contact an IT professional to have your device checked for malware. If you have accessed your bank account or other payment systems while the remote access software was operating on your device  report this to the relevant account providers. If you keep getting phone calls from scammers  report them to your telecommunications provider.

    "Name": "Fake Celebrity Investment Scam \u2013 Multiple trading platforms",
    "Date": "13/05/2024",
    "Description": "The FMA has received several reports regarding fake celebrity endorsement advertisements on social media  promoting online investment schemes. We have identified multiple websites that are part of this scam but believe there may be more connected as they frequently change. We are aware of several New Zealanders who have invested through these websites and are now unable to withdraw funds  with additional fees requested before allowing withdrawals.&nbsp; How the scam works: The scammer creates an advertisement on a social media platform featuring a deepfake video of an interview with a celebrity or a fake news article  appearing to be from a reputable New Zealand media platform. The ad usually includes the image of a New Zealand celebrity with an attention-grabbing headline. The ad does not at first glance appear to be about investing. Clicking on this ad leads to a fake news article on an imposter website designed to look like a reputable New Zealand news platform. This article describes an interview with the celebrity where they discuss making big profits using a certain investment platform.&nbsp; The article contains a link to the website of an investment platform \u2013 often trading cryptocurrencies or foreign exchange \u2013 where people are asked to register for an account and provide contact details. &nbsp;&nbsp; After providing this information  a call is received from someone claiming to be a broker or a financial adviser instructing the person to make a payment of $250 USD or \u20ac250.&nbsp; They may instruct the person to download remote access software such as \u201cAnyDesk\u201d so the fake adviser can \u201chelp\u201d with the investments. The scammer will transfer \u201cprofits\u201d to the victim\u2019s bank account giving a false impression of legitimacy.&nbsp; Instructions are then made to make higher investments  and dashboards are provided tracking these apparent investments. When the victim asks to withdraw funds  they are told they must first pay a high fee to release the money. But even if these fees are paid  no money is returned. The FMA recommends extreme caution when engaging with social media advertising using the image of celebrities to promote investment opportunities. &nbsp; If you come across these ads  do not click on them and don\u2019t give them your personal information. &nbsp; What to do if you think you have been scammed: Stop all contact with the scammer and do not send any money. Contact your bank immediately. Ask if a transaction reversal is possible. If you sent money using another payment service provider  ask them to trace the funds. &nbsp; If you have downloaded remote access software on the instructions of the scammers  immediately contact an IT professional to have your device checked for malware. If you have accessed your bank account or other payment systems while the remote access software was operating on your device  report this to the relevant account providers. &nbsp; If you keep getting phone calls from scammers  report them to your telecommunications provider. &nbsp; If you are getting spam emails and text messages  report these to the Department of Internal Affairs here: Spam-Report-Spam - dia.govt.nz.&nbsp; Tell a trusted relative or friend what has happened. They may help you see the situation more clearly  help you deal with the scammers  and suggest what to do next.&nbsp; Contact Victim Support\u202fon 0800 842 846 or\u202fvisit their website.

Investors were then asked to contact their own bank to recall the large payments; &nbsp; This successful \u201creturn\u201d of a large sum created a false impression that Market2Cap was a legitimate business; &nbsp; Investors were then asked to re-transfer this recalled payment  and start making all further payments into overseas bank accounts; &nbsp; The FMA believes Market2Cap is willing to sacrifice an initial small payment to make its business appear legitimate. Their main targets are the later  larger payments.&nbsp; These overseas bank accounts are used to receive funds from investors:&nbsp; Account name: Royal Dash Computer Software Trading Bank: Wio Bank PJSC Account number: AE670860000009718122732 Country: United Arab Emirates Account Name: Centurion Telecom FZ LLC Bank: Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC &nbsp;Account number: AE340030011328177920002 &nbsp;Country: United Arab Emirates&nbsp; The Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission (ASIC) has issued a public warning about Market2Cap offering financial services without a licence  see that here: &nbsp; Investor warning - https://market2cap.com (moneysmart.gov.au)&nbsp; Financial services provided by Market2Cap requires it to be registered and licensed in New Zealand.

    "Description": "We are aware that a New Zealand resident has been contacted by individuals claiming to represent the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and offering assistance to recover money lost in a previous scam. The email address used is different to the email domains used by the FCA. The FCA advises on its website that they send emails from addresses ending in: fca.org.uk fcanewsletters.org.uk fcamails.org.uk [Updated 8 August 2024]: Recent reports have revealed more about the tactics used by these FCA impersonators. Victims tend to receive an email saying that the FCA has recovered their lost funds  but in the form of cryptocurrency. If the victim responds  the impersonators then instruct them to set up a cryptocurrency wallet. The impersonators then ask the victim to deposit some money into the new wallet  saying this will help release their lost funds. The impersonators will then take these funds out of the victim's cryptocurrency wallet. Scammers will sometimes use other tactics to extract even more money from their targets. After a victim deposits cryptocurrency and the first stage of the scam is complete  the scammers move on to impersonate other regulators. We have received a report of one of the scammers purporting to be from the New Zealand Financial Markets Authority (FMA). A victim was told that a money transfer had been suspended and more payment was needed before funds could be released. However  no money is returned  no matter how many payments the victim makes to the scammers. We remain concerned that this is a recovery scam using the name of the FCA and the FMA. We recommend caution when dealing with anyone claiming to be from financial regulators or authorities offering to help recover money.

It will also inform the public that statutory notices issued by the FMA must be complied with.&nbsp; The FMA considers that it is not in the public interest to file legal proceedings in this case.",

Hatton Financial Services Limited is a New Zealand incorporated company and the trading name of Theresa Hatton an Authorised Financial Adviser.&nbsp; The FMA is satisfied that the offers of employment are not from Hatton Financial Services Limited and an unidentified third party is using publically available information in order to create the impression that the position is with a legitimate New Zealand company.&nbsp; Therefore we would like to emphasise that Ms Hatton\u2019s conduct is not under investigation by the FMA.

    "Description": "WARNING: Unsolicited offer for Sky City Entertainment Group Limited Shares and further expected unsolicited offers.REASON FOR WARNING: Shareholders in Sky City Entertainment Group Limited should be wary of an offer dated 18 April 2011 from NZ Investment Securities LP (NZIS) to buy their shares for $2.30 per share.The general partner of NZ Investment Securities LP is Mr Bernard Whimp. The Commission is currently taking legal proceedings against NZ Investment Securities LP and other limited partnerships associated with Mr Whimp. The Commission considers that it cannot be in a shareholder's interests to accept the offer for the following reasons.The amount offered per share is less than the current market price of the shares. The most recent market price for the shares is available on the NZX website at&nbsp;www.nzx.com. At 11.00am on 20 April 2011  the market price was $3.39 per share.If a shareholder instead sold their shares through a broker  they would receive the full market price (less any fees payable).That means that any shareholder who sold their shares to NZIS today would lose around $1 per share - or around a third of their shares' value.In addition  payment for the shares will not be made until up to 14 days after NZIS has received notification from the share registry that the shares have been transferred. It is therefore likely that shareholders will not receive payment for shares sold under the offer for at least 3 weeks after they accept it.If a shareholder instead sold their shares through a broker  they would likely receive payment within 3 working days. The offers suggest that there is an urgent need for investors to act on the offers. The Commission is not aware of any such urgency.It is not illegal to make an unsolicited offer to buy investments or to offer to buy them at a price below their current market value. However it is against the law to mislead or deceive investors into accepting an offer.The Commission is aware that Mr Whimp  and some other people  have recently requested the share registers of a number of other listed companies and is concerned that other unsolicited offers may be made in the coming weeks.Any investor who receives an unsolicited offer is encouraged to treat such an offer with great caution  to carefully read the offer in full including any fine print anywhere on the forms  and to take the time to make a few important checks.Contact: Rebecca Barclay 04 471 7666",

A boiler room is a collective term for fraudulent individuals and organizations using clever salespeople to call potential investors to pressure them into buying shares that promise high returns (cold calling). In reality the shares are either worthless or non-existent. The AFM has established that nlpoyo.vip does not have an AFM license or a European Passport.",
