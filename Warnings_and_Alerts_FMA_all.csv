"IPO websites - harvesting investor details",28/03/2025,"Company: IPO websites - harvesting investor details\nCity: \nFSPR: \nThe FMA is concerned about a number of IPO (Initial Public Offering) websites which claim to alert investors of upcoming share buying opportunities before they go public (Pre-IPO). Many of these websites refer to an upcoming IPO for the satellite internet company Starlink. We may continue to add further websites to this warning as we become aware of them. How the scam works These websites claim to help investors get early access to IPO investment opportunities. They may also claim to provide “top picks” of upcoming IPOs  or market trends and insights. Site users are prompted to enter personal contact details and proposed investments into an online form. They are then told they will be emailed “alerts” about new IPOs  or be called by a representative. Investors are then either convinced via email or telephone to invest  often being told that this is a ‘limited opportunity’  or that the price of shares will soon rise quickly.&nbsp; The investor will be asked to fill out application forms and provide identity documents such as a passport to open an account and satisfy relevant “Know Your Customer” requirements.&nbsp; The scammers email a Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) which does not meet the FMA’s requirements for PDS – for more information on PDS scams see the article: How to identify a product disclosure statement (PDS) or prospectus scam. The investor will then be instructed to transfer their funds to a bank account or via cryptocurrency. Being asked to pay for shares via cryptocurrency is a red flag. Often the victim only becomes aware they are part of a scam when the news of the impending IPO is never announced  their broker stops answering emails or they try to withdraw their investment. &nbsp; For more information on IPO’s and how they work see our article Spotlight on: IPOs.&nbsp; You can also read a real life case study of a New Zealander who narrowly avoided being scammed in a fake Starlink IPO investment: Starlink fraud case study. &nbsp; Contacts to be wary of Websites skyinvesthub.com ipoalerts.pro &nbsp; ipoalertspro.com orbitipo.com &nbsp; techgrowthinvest.com top5investinsider.com satellitestocks.com orbittrades.com Telephone Orbit IPO +44 20 8895 6969 &nbsp; Tech Growth Invest +44 20 8895 6969 Satellite Stocks +44 20 8895 6969 Orbit Trades +44 20 8895 6969 Email Sky Invest Hub - info@skyinvesthub.com IPO Alerts - Info@ipoalertspro.com IPO Alerts Pro - Info@ipoalertspro.com Orbit IPO - info@OrbitIPO.com Tech Growth Invest - info@TechGrowthInvest.com Top 5 Invest Insider - info@top5investinsider.com Satellite Stocks - info@orbitstocksalerthub.com Orbit Trades – info@orbitstocksalerthub.com What to do if you think you might be affected by this scam If you’re making a transfer for any investment and get a&nbsp;Confirmation of Payee error.

"Ashbourne Wealth Management - Hybrid scam: investments, advance fees, money mule recruitment",13/03/2025,"Company: Ashbourne Wealth Management - Hybrid scam: investments  advance fees  money mule recruitment\nCity: \nFSPR: \nWe are concerned that Ashbourne Wealth Management may be operating a scam. Ashbourne Wealth Management is a fake online investment platform  which tricks investors into laundering fraudulent funds. How the scam works Ashbourne Wealth Management posts advertisements on social media  encouraging victims to invest. The victim’s small initial investment quickly grows to large profits. Ashbourne Wealth Management tells the victim they will need to pay a large upfront fee to withdraw their profits. When the victim is unable or unwilling to pay  Ashbourne Wealth Management offers to pay the fees for the victim. The victim receives funds into their bank account from a third party who is the victim of a recovery room scam. The victim is then instructed to forward the funds received to Ashbourne Wealth Management to pay for the withdrawal fees. The victim has unknowingly become a money mule for Ashbourne Wealth Management. We recommend caution when dealing with any person or entity that operates the same or similar ways described above. If a person or entity asks you to receive funds and instructs you to pay them on to a third party  exercise extreme caution. These are warning signs that the entity may be operating a money mule scam. Ashbourne Wealth Management is not registered to provide financial services in New Zealand. Always check whether a financial service provider is registered on the Financial Service Providers Register (FSPR) before accepting an offer of financial services.

Bit Pro Gain says it is offering an online trading platform but is operating an investment scam.&nbsp; We have received a report from a New Zealand investor who created an account with Bit Pro Gain through the website bitprogain.io  and began with a small credit card payment to the platform. The investor says that Bit Pro Gain then took several unauthorised payments from the investor’s bank account  totalling more than $250 000.&nbsp; Scam uses remote access software to access financial information When an investor creates a new account with Bit Pro Gain  they are prompted to install an app on their phone. Users are told the app will let them receive notifications about their investments. However  the app is a remote access application  which can grant Bit Pro Gain access to notifications and messages from the user’s phone and other devices. Bit Pro Gain may be able to use this access to receive users’ banking information or 2 factor authentication codes. Bit Pro Gain is operating through multiple websites We have concerns that bitpro-gain.com may be associated with the same investment scam  as the website offers similar services to bitprogain.io and uses the name Bit Pro-Gain. The website also displays a doctored version of a New Zealand Certificate of Incorporation.&nbsp; The Alberta Securities Commission has published a warning about the website bitprogain.com  which Bit Pro Gain has previously used to promote this scam.

These platforms are being used as part of an investment scam. Once a person invests in one of these platforms  they are presented with a login where they can see the “profits” they have earned.

"YouTube cryptocurrency investment scam",16/12/2024,"Company: YouTube cryptocurrency investment scam\nCity: \nFSPR: \nThe FMA is aware of an investment scam which is using YouTube channels to promote fake crypto investment websites. The FMA reminds the public to always use the Financial Service Provider Register (FSPR) to check if a trading platform is registered to provide financial products and services to New Zealand. View the Financial Service Providers Register (FSPR) How the scam works The scammers post videos on YouTube or other social media platforms offering crypto “tips” and trading advice. These YouTube channels invite viewers to join private WhatsApp or Telegram groups for discussions on crypto investments. Prize offers and gifts are used to encourage viewers to join up. Scammers may also encourage viewers to comment on their videos. This can give the scammers access to viewers’ contact details  which then lets the scammers approach viewers directly via WhatsApp or Telegram. Once the user has accepted a WhatsApp or Telegram invite  scammers present themselves as an investment ‘expert’  ‘mentor’ or ‘coach’  and start offering investment advice. The scammer will make unrealistic promises about these crypto investments  for example “earn above $2000 - $7000 daily on crypto” or “avoid risks and generate profit... within three days”. The scammer will introduce the user to a fake investment platform. These fake platforms may imitate well-known cryptocurrency exchanges. The scammer will then coach the user through investing. Often  they will first encourage their victim to invest a small amount of money. They are then told they’ve earned big profits and encouraged to invest even more money. When the victim asks to withdraw their funds  they are told they must first pay a fee to release the money; even if these fees are paid  no money is paid out. If you come across these videos  or investment platforms like this  or you’re added to unknown group chats  don’t engage with them and don’t give out any personal information or identity documents. View our warning about an earlier version of this scam  which used ads on social media platforms to link customers to WhatsApp groups. What to do if you think you have been scammed Stop all contact with the scammer and don’t send any money. Report the videos to YouTube  report any advice&nbsp;groups to WhatsApp or Telegram  and block the scammer on all your devices. Contact your bank immediately. Ask if a transaction reversal is possible. If you sent money using another payment service provider  ask them to trace the funds. If you are getting spam emails and text messages  report these to the&nbsp;Department of Internal Affairs. Tell a trusted relative or friend what has happened. They may help you see the situation more clearly  help you deal with the scammers  and suggest what to do next.

Please see our past warnings about these scams: Heartland Bank - Fake term deposits and bonds HSBC - Fake term deposits Kiwibank - Comparison website harvesting investor details Rates Finder - Comparison website harvesting investor details How the scam works The victim sees an advertisement or visits an invest comparison website (like comparetermdepositsnz.com)  where they are prompted to enter their contact details. The victim receives a call from someone claiming to be an investment adviser from a well-known New Zealand firm. The ‘investment adviser’ will speak to the victim about an investment opportunity  usually with a well-known New Zealand bank or investment firm. The adviser may provide detailed but fraudulent investment documentation to the victim while attempting to persuade them to invest. Once the victim makes their investment  the scammer ceases contact  and the funds are lost. Website redirection service may also be used to redirect people to the official website of an organisation to mislead people into thinking that the scam website is legitimate. We recommend caution when dealing with people who claim to be from well-known investment management firms  especially after you enter your personal details in deposit comparison websites such as comparetermdepositsnz.com. Investors should conduct due diligence checks by contacting the investment firm or financial institution the caller claims to represent  to verify their identity before investing.

PRIAMA claims to be a brokerage firm based in China and Japan. We are aware of a victim who started investing in shares with PRIAMA after being cold called by a PRIAMA representative. This victim is now unable to withdraw their funds and has been instructed by PRIAMA to pay high advance fees and taxes to release the funds. Even after paying these fees  no money is returned. PRIAMA is not registered on the Financial Service Providers Register to provide financial services in New Zealand.

"WhatsApp educational and investment platform scam",07/08/2024,"Company: WhatsApp educational and investment platform scam\nCity: \nFSPR: \nThe FMA is aware of an investment scam currently circulating New Zealand involving multiple WhatsApp groups  websites and investment platforms. We may update this warning as we are made aware of further websites  as the names frequently change. Some of these websites may have obtained licenses from overseas authorities or appear to be endorsed by media articles which have been written and distributed by the investment platforms to provide credibility. The FMA reminds the public to always check the Financial Service Provider Register (FSPR) to see if an entity is registered to provide financial products and services to New Zealanders. Visit the Financial Service Provider Register (FSPR) How the scam works The scammer creates an ad on social media platform offering free education or tips on investment trading. Users are then prompted to join a WhatsApp group after clicking the ad. Alternatively  the scammer may add phone numbers directly to a WhatsApp group  without the user interacting with an ad first. The WhatsApp group is led by someone described as a “mentor  “coach” “professor” or “assistant”. The groups promise unrealistic returns such as turning $100k into $10m within 6-12 months  with their help. Gift cards  credit or free trades might be provided for attending sessions or completing educational training courses. The mentor will introduce and recommend an investment platform to the victim. Scammers have gone to great lengths to make these online platforms appear authentic. The investment platform will message users  helping them set up an account and make transfers. The user will then be able to make several trades  believing the platform to be authentic  which encourages them to invest more money. When the victim asks to withdraw funds  they are told they must first pay a fee to release the money; even if these fees are paid  no money is paid out. If you come across these ads or investment platforms  do not click on them and don't give them your personal information or identity documents. Learn more about Investment software packages and seminars What to do if you think you have been scammed Stop all contact with the scammer and do not send any money. Report the group to WhatsApp and block the scammer on all devices. Contact your bank immediately. Ask if a transaction reversal is possible. If you sent money using another payment service provider  ask them to trace the funds. If you are getting spam emails and text messages  report these to the Department of Internal Affairs.

"Deepfake video scam warning: fake news stories, political endorsements - multiple trading platforms",06/08/2024,"Company: Deepfake video scam warning: fake news stories  political endorsements - multiple trading platforms\nCity: \nFSPR: \nThe FMA has received several reports about a scam using fake endorsements supposedly coming from New Zealand politicians. Their names and images are being faked and misused to promote online investment schemes. This scam uses fake news stories  spread through multiple websites and advertisements  with the names of investment schemes and websites used to promote the scam changing frequently. Updated 9 October 2024 The FMA is aware that this scam is now using fake news articles featuring claims that New Zealanders will receive “income” or “dividend” payments from IRD. The fake claims say that money will be sent to New Zealanders after they sign up with an online investment platform. These fake news articles include photographs of New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and other New Zealand politicians and feature headlines such as: “By the order of Christopher Luxon  New Zealand residents will start receiving income from taxes.” Inland Revenue has confirmed these claims are false. There is no pool of tax funds becoming available for distribution to New Zealanders. How the scam works Scammers draw in victims through advertisements placed on social media platforms and news aggregators. There are several variations of these advertisements. Some ads: Show an image of a politician next to a fictional quote about a new investment opportunity e.g.  ""According to Christopher Luxon  all citizens of New Zealand can officially retire at the age of 45!"" Contain generic images  with a headline designed to promote fear about the stability of New Zealand pensions e.g.  ""PENSION PAYMENTS WILL BE CANCELLED IN THE NEW ZEALAND!"". Feature deepfake videos of politicians  including New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters. These fake videos show the politician being interviewed about a new investment opportunity which they have invested in personally  or which is claimed to be endorsed by the government. These advertisements link to fake news articles featuring false quotes and endorsements from politicians  usually promoting an investment platform. These articles are often made to appear as though they are being published by legitimate New Zealand media organisations. These fake news articles have links to other websites  advertising investment platforms or promoting educational materials about investments. The websites include registration forms  where potential victims are prompted to enter their contact details. Scammers will then contact the victim claiming to be an investment broker and give instructions for investing through the platform. Victims are encouraged to make a small investment at first (around US$250/NZ$420). Requests for larger investments will likely follow. &nbsp; Exercise caution The FMA recommends extreme caution when engaging with social media advertisements or links in news aggregators that include fake political endorsements promoting investment opportunities. Do not click on these ads or links  and do not enter your personal information into these websites. If you have been contacted by a scammer after entering your personal information into one of these websites  do not make any payments or transfer any money to the scammers. Related warning View Fake celebrity investment scam - multiple platforms What to do if you think you have been scammed? Contact your bank immediately. Ask if a transaction reversal is possible.

We have received a report of Youtube videos promoting these bots as part of a scam. How does the scam work? Scammers create Youtube channels and publish videos promoting cryptocurrency ‘sniping bots’ or ‘MEV bots’. The videos claim that these bots can exploit arbitrage opportunities in cryptocurrency  allowing users to generate a risk-free passive income from their cryptocurrency holdings. These videos often feature AI-generated voiceover and images  which allows the scammers to quickly publish multiple videos. The videos will usually include unrealistic promises about profits  often claiming that users can earn over $1 000 per day from a relatively small cryptocurrency holding. The videos will usually claim that the bot will only work if linked to a cryptocurrency wallet containing at least a certain amount of cryptocurrency. This is a tactic used to encourage victims to invest significant amounts in the scam without first testing the investment with a smaller sum. The videos encourage viewers to activate the bot by downloading then executing code  which is linked in the video’s description. The code is designed to appear as though it will allow the victim to withdraw their funds at any time. However  the code will hide the details of another cryptocurrency wallet  which is controlled by the scammer. Once the victim runs the code and enters the details of their cryptocurrency wallet  the contents of the wallet will be transferred to the scammer. We have received reports of these videos being advertised to New Zealand investors. Cryptocurrencies are often the target of hacking  online fraud and scams  and where cryptoassets have been lost to a scam they are often impossible to recover.

"Fake Celebrity Investment Scam – Multiple trading platforms",13/05/2024,"Company: Fake Celebrity Investment Scam – Multiple trading platforms\nCity: \nFSPR: \nThe FMA has received several reports regarding fake celebrity endorsement advertisements on social media  promoting online investment schemes. We have identified multiple websites that are part of this scam but believe there may be more connected as they frequently change. We are aware of several New Zealanders who have invested through these websites and are now unable to withdraw funds  with additional fees requested before allowing withdrawals.&nbsp; How the scam works: The scammer creates an advertisement on a social media platform featuring a deepfake video of an interview with a celebrity or a fake news article  appearing to be from a reputable New Zealand media platform. The ad usually includes the image of a New Zealand celebrity with an attention-grabbing headline. The ad does not at first glance appear to be about investing. Clicking on this ad leads to a fake news article on an imposter website designed to look like a reputable New Zealand news platform. This article describes an interview with the celebrity where they discuss making big profits using a certain investment platform.&nbsp; The article contains a link to the website of an investment platform – often trading cryptocurrencies or foreign exchange – where people are asked to register for an account and provide contact details. &nbsp;&nbsp; After providing this information  a call is received from someone claiming to be a broker or a financial adviser instructing the person to make a payment of $250 USD or €250.&nbsp; They may instruct the person to download remote access software such as “AnyDesk” so the fake adviser can “help” with the investments. The scammer will transfer “profits” to the victim’s bank account giving a false impression of legitimacy.&nbsp; Instructions are then made to make higher investments  and dashboards are provided tracking these apparent investments. When the victim asks to withdraw funds  they are told they must first pay a high fee to release the money. But even if these fees are paid  no money is returned. The FMA recommends extreme caution when engaging with social media advertising using the image of celebrities to promote investment opportunities. &nbsp; If you come across these ads  do not click on them and don’t give them your personal information. &nbsp; What to do if you think you have been scammed: Stop all contact with the scammer and do not send any money. Contact your bank immediately. Ask if a transaction reversal is possible. If you sent money using another payment service provider  ask them to trace the funds. &nbsp; If you have downloaded remote access software on the instructions of the scammers  immediately contact an IT professional to have your device checked for malware. If you have accessed your bank account or other payment systems while the remote access software was operating on your device  report this to the relevant account providers. &nbsp; If you keep getting phone calls from scammers  report them to your telecommunications provider. &nbsp; If you are getting spam emails and text messages  report these to the Department of Internal Affairs here: Spam-Report-Spam - dia.govt.nz.&nbsp; Tell a trusted relative or friend what has happened. They may help you see the situation more clearly  help you deal with the scammers  and suggest what to do next.&nbsp; Contact Victim Support on 0800 842 846 or visit their website.

The email address used is different to the email domains used by the FCA. The FCA advises on its website that they send emails from addresses ending in: fca.org.uk fcanewsletters.org.uk fcamails.org.uk [Updated 8 August 2024]: Recent reports have revealed more about the tactics used by these FCA impersonators. Victims tend to receive an email saying that the FCA has recovered their lost funds  but in the form of cryptocurrency. If the victim responds  the impersonators then instruct them to set up a cryptocurrency wallet. The impersonators then ask the victim to deposit some money into the new wallet  saying this will help release their lost funds. The impersonators will then take these funds out of the victim's cryptocurrency wallet. Scammers will sometimes use other tactics to extract even more money from their targets. After a victim deposits cryptocurrency and the first stage of the scam is complete  the scammers move on to impersonate other regulators. We have received a report of one of the scammers purporting to be from the New Zealand Financial Markets Authority (FMA). A victim was told that a money transfer had been suspended and more payment was needed before funds could be released. However  no money is returned  no matter how many payments the victim makes to the scammers. We remain concerned that this is a recovery scam using the name of the FCA and the FMA.

MrPatterson pleaded guilty to one charge under section 12 of the FSP Act for holding out that he was in the business of providing financial services when not registered or a member of an approved dispute resolution scheme. Mr Patterson also pleaded guilty to a separate charge under section 61 of the Financial Markets Authority Act 2011.In the FMA’s view  Mr Branton-Casey facilitated Mr Patterson’s offending by being the (former) registered financial adviser who signed and submitted insurance application forms completed by Mr Patterson for clients  in circumstances where Mr Branton-Casey had not met or advised the relevant clients and knew that Mr Patterson was not a registered financial adviser. In doing so  Mr Branton-Casey failed to exercise the care  diligence and skill expected of a reasonable financial adviser in the circumstances.Sales and advice continues to be a key strategic priority for the FMA. The FMA is focused on ensuring that clients’ interests are properly considered and that financial services are provided in accordance with the FA Act by duly registered individuals. The FMA will take action in order to denounce and deter misconduct in relation to the provision of financial services and non-compliance with the FA Act. When considering what further action (if any) is appropriate  the FMA must also consider public interest factors when making its decisions.In this case  the FMA is satisfied that there is a low risk of similar misconduct by Mr Branton-Casey occurring again in the future. Mr Branton-Casey was co-operative with the FMA  including by: Voluntarily de-registering as a registered financial adviser from the Financial Service Providers Register; and&nbsp; Giving evidence at the prosecution brought by the FMA against Mr Patterson. In these circumstances  the FMA is satisfied that public interest supports a warning rather than court action.Having completed its investigation  the FMA has determined that issuing a public warning to Mr Branton-Casey in relation to his previous professional conduct is proportionate and appropriate in the circumstances.Jonathan Branton-Casey has also offered  and the FMA accepted  an Enforceable Undertaking pursuant to section 46 of the Financial Markets Authority Act 2011.RelatedCase: Jonathan Simon Antony Branton-Casey - Enforceable undertakingCase:&nbsp;Garry James PattersonMedia release: Individual falsely holding himself out as financial adviser sentenced to community work and community detention&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,

The FMA is satisfied that Mr Ferguson contravened section 34 of the Financial Advisers Act 2008 (FA Act) when he copied and pasted the signatures  because the conduct involved was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. The FMA has concluded that Mr Ferguson should receive a formal warning concerning this conduct.&nbsp; The FMA has also concluded it is in the interests of fair  transparent financial markets that this warning should be published. Details of Mr Ferguson’s conduct is as follows: In one instance when an insurance provider required a declaration of the clients’ continuing good health  Mr Ferguson requested a member of the administrative staff to copy and paste the client’s signature on three separate documents by creating a copy of the client’s signature from elsewhere on the application and physically taping it onto the missing signature box.&nbsp; Mr Ferguson claims he did this with the verbal consent of the client. In one further instance when an insurance provider rejected a client application due to a missing signature  with the policyholder’s consent  Mr Ferguson personally copied and pasted the missing signature by physically taping a copy of the client’s signature from elsewhere on the application form onto the missing signature box. This conduct occurred between approximately October 2016 and April 2018 when Mr Ferguson was employed and/or contracted by Preferred NZ Limited.",,,,,,,,,,

During the campaign questions were raised by PledgeMe relating to Crafters’ solvency  following which the campaign was withdrawn by Crafters. No investor money was received by Crafters as a result of this withdrawal.PledgeMe referred this matter to the FMA.In our view the offer information used by Crafters as part of the crowdfunding campaign contained misleading and deceptive statements relating to the stated valuation of Crafters  the assets that Crafters claimed to hold  and the solvency of Crafters at the time of the campaign.Part 2 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 provides that a person  in trade  must not engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive in relation to any dealing in financial products.&nbsp; These provisions apply to offers of shares made through crowdfunding platforms even though these offers are less regulated and there is no requirement for investors to be given all information that may be important to their investment decision.Accurate and reliable representations of a company are an essential component of any investment  including crowdfunding  and ensure that potential investors are able to rely on statements made by entities they are considering investing in.Before making any decision to invest in a crowdfunding campaign &nbsp;we encourage prospective investors to conduct their own research into the potential investment  including understanding what background checks the particular platform provider conducts on entities raising money on their platform.",,,,,,,,,,

"Pacific Edge Limited",25/05/2015,"Company: Pacific Edge Limited\nCity: \nFSPR: \nThe Financial Markets Authority (FMA) has issued a warning to Pacific Edge Limited (Pacific Edge) in relation to alleged breaches of continuous disclosure obligations. Following an investigation by the FMA  it is the FMA’s view that it is likely Pacific Edge contravened NZX Main Board Listing Rule 10.1.1(a) (the Listing Rule) and  accordingly  section 19B of the Securities Markets Act 1988 (the Act). The relevant facts are as follows: In October 2013  Pacific Edge Diagnostics USA  a subsidiary of Pacific Edge  entered into agreements with two organisations based in the United States of America  FedMed and American’s Choice Provider Network (ACPN) under which those organisations agreed to provide access to their respective national provider network in the United States of America for PEB’s CxBladder product. PEB disclosed to NZX Limited (NZX) the signing of each agreement some days after the relevant agreement was signed. In the period between signing and disclosure to NZX  PEB was seeking approval from the contractual counterparty to announce the signing of the agreement. Following the announcement of each agreement the price in PEB’s shares increased. The FMA considers that the execution of the ACPN and FedMed agreements amounted to material information and that consequently Pacific Edge ought to have disclosed the signing of each agreement to the NZX immediately upon execution of the agreements.The FMA considers that the failure to immediately disclose to the NZX the signing of the agreements with FedMed and ACPN is likely to have contravened the Listing Rule and s19B of the Act. Failure to make the disclosure in a timely way means that shareholders who traded in shares may have done so without having available to them all material information regarding the company and without the market price of the shares when sold reflecting that price impact of that material information.FMA further considers that any investor that sold Pacific Edge shares after the agreements were signed but before the announcements were made may be eligible for compensation pursuant to the compensation provisions in the Act.&nbsp;Following engagement with the FMA with respect to the matter PEB has: undertaken a compliance audit and has implemented the audit recommendations; agreed to make a compensation payment of $500 000 to be distributed to shareholders who sold PEB shares during the period of delay between signing of the agreements and the announcement to the NZX. The process for payment of compensation is set out in a Settlement Deed which has been agreed between the FMA and PEB. PEB has indicated that it may offer eligible shareholders the option of a cash payment or for those who may be entitled to a payment of $500 or more  to receive new PEB shares  in lieu of cash. The FMA does not endorse the share offer and expressly encourages any eligible shareholder to seek independent financial and legal advice with respect to the PEB offer. A copy of the Settlement Deed can be found here. Having assessed the conduct involved and notwithstanding its conclusion that the Listing Rule and the Act have likely been breached  the FMA has determined that the appropriate and proportionate enforcement response is to accept PEB’s offer to make compensation to affected shareholders and to issue this warning.Compliance with secondary markets disclosure obligations is a key strategic priority for the FMA and is critical for ensuring that investors are able to participate in a fully informed market.RelatedPacific Edge Limited - Settlement deedMedia release -&nbsp;FMA issues warning on continuous disclosure obligations and secures $500 000 compensation payment from Pacific Edge Limited",,,,,,,,,,

"Warning: Beware of misleading advertising promoting UK pension scheme transfers",18/12/2014,"Company: Warning: Beware of misleading advertising promoting UK pension scheme transfers\nCity: \nFSPR: \nThe Financial Markets Authority (FMA) is warning people to be cautious of potentially misleading and deceptive advertising about transferring United Kingdom pension scheme entitlements to New Zealand.&nbsp;The FMA has been monitoring promotional materials and advertisements that encourage people to transfer their UK pension scheme entitlements  and has requested that certain materials be removed from publication. Some of these materials appear designed to alarm people about changes to the tax treatment of their UK pension scheme entitlements in New Zealand and the accessibility of their entitlements due to proposed changes to UK legislation in April 2015. “We are concerned that people are feeling press-ganged into transferring their pension scheme entitlements from the UK and being put under pressure to act now ” said Elaine Campbell  FMA's Director of Compliance. “For people thinking about transferring their UK pension scheme entitlements  those savings are likely to be one of the most substantial assets accumulated over their working life. Before making a significant decision like this  it’s essential they seek professional financial advice that is personalised for their own circumstances - and also consider talking to a tax specialist ” said Ms. Campbell. A guiding principle of Inland Revenue’s approach on taxing foreign superannuation in New Zealand states  “from a New Zealand tax perspective  the tax outcome for a person who migrates with a foreign superannuation scheme should be broadly the same irrespective of whether the person transferred their funds to a New Zealand superannuation scheme on day one  or left it with the foreign scheme provider. This reflects the principle that tax should not distort a person’s economic decision-making.”[i] Ms. Campbell said  “We are concerned that tax issues and a misleading sense of urgency are being exploited by some providers to scare people into transferring their money  without offering a balanced view of the potential pros and cons involved.” The FMA recommends that anybody considering transferring their UK pension scheme entitlements should seek personalised financial advice and make sure they are confident that transferring their entitlements from the UK is in their best interests.&nbsp;The FMA notes that ‘old age’ state pensions provided by the UK government at retirement are not transferrable  so this warning does not apply to these pensions.&nbsp;Under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013  financial market participants must not engage in misleading or deceptive conduct  including in statements made in advertising.

"FMA warns consumers about cold-calling investment offers and ‘big win’ scams",23/10/2014,"Company: FMA warns consumers about cold-calling investment offers and ‘big win’ scams\nCity: \nFSPR: \nThe Financial Markets Authority (FMA) is warning New Zealand consumers and investors to be wary of cold-calls asking them to buy shares or put their money into offshore firms. The FMA is receiving an increasing number of complaints about suspicious offers that involve transferring funds overseas. The flow of complaints relates to firms or people making cold-calls and offering suspicious ‘big win’ products or services  including investment schemes and forex trading services. The FMA’s Director of Compliance  Elaine Campbell  said today’s warning is targeted at cold-calling ‘big win’ scams  most often from overseas or unknown locations. “There are some tell-tale signs to beware of that should cause consumers to take extra caution.”&nbsp; These include: Requests to transfer funds overseas quickly to the account of a firm or person. Claims you must ‘act now or miss out’  putting your money in now to enjoy a big payoff. Discouraging or prohibiting customers from seeking independent professional advice about the product  service  or transaction. Offers involving software or so-called “trading systems” – often for forex trading – where consumers must buy a license or software  in order to participate. Ms Campbell said  “There’s one principle to keep in mind: if an offer sounds too good to be true  then it probably is. Our advice is simple. Don’t transfer funds offshore to firms  or people  making offers like this – hang up the phone.&nbsp; If you don’t understand an investment or product  don’t put your money in.” “Transferring funds offshore – especially to firms that you don’t recognise or can’t fully verify – adds unnecessary risk for consumers. &nbsp;Generally  the FMA cannot help consumers to recover funds once they have transferred sums offshore.“ The FMA is aware of firms providing fake website URLs that appear to be for a big-brand firm. The FMA publishes names of firms and people where it has identified an entity or a person who is operating without registration or authorisation in New Zealand  or where the firm or person is not complying with New Zealand’s financial services law. There is also a similar international list on FMA’s website provided by the&nbsp;International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). &nbsp;However  even where names or firms of cold-callers do not appear on these lists  consumers should not assume they are operating legitimately. Ms Campbell said checking that firms are licensed or regulated in other countries could help consumers verify that such a firm exists. “But the fact that a firm is licensed or registered is not a guarantee for your money ” she said. Ms Campbell said consumers could use resources provided by the FMA and Consumer Affairs New Zealand that are designed to alert people to common characteristics of dubious offers. “Consumers don’t need to be drawn into these dubious offers. They can participate in well-regulated  genuine offers made by firms operating in New Zealand. &nbsp;There is plenty of choice in investment and financial services products that are provided by reliable firms and professionals. “Genuine financial products and services offer consumers the protection of New Zealand law. All financial services products and securities contain some element of risk  so it’s a good idea to seek some professional advice.” Links to regulator and consumer websites in New Zealand: http://www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz/scams/scam-types/get-rich-quick-investment-scams http://www.consumeraffairs.govt.nz/scams",,,,,,,,,,

In particular &nbsp;we warn those persons to take into account that: In&nbsp;our view  General Equity has engaged in conduct and has made statements that are misleading and deceptive in connection with its status as a financial markets participant and how it is regulated in New Zealand. General Equity is not a licensed financial markets participant in New Zealand  does not have to meet any prudential requirements (including minimum capital requirements) in New Zealand and is not a New Zealand bank or a non-bank deposit taker. In our view  General Equity has engaged in conduct and has made statements that are misleading and deceptive in connection with The General Equity Asset Builder Fund No 1 (ABF1). In&nbsp;our view  the ABF1 does not hold the assets General Equity claims it holds and was used by General Equity to give a misleading impression of adequate asset backing to support the issuance of letters of credit by General Equity. Most of General Equity’s business is conducted outside of New Zealand. That business is subject to the laws of  and oversight of financial markets regulators  of those places where it conducts that business.&nbsp;We have&nbsp;limited ability at law to take action in connection with financial services provided by New Zealand entities outside of New Zealand.

Any website operated by or on behalf of General Equity and each associated person of General Equity must contain  on the main page of the website  a warning statement in the form attached as Annexure A to this Order (Warning Statement). 2. The Warning Statement is required to be displayed:(a) Prominently; (b) In black font no smaller than the font contained in Annexure A to this Order; and (c) In the same layout as the layout used in Annexure A to this Order.3. General Equity must provide a copy of this order to each associated person of General Equity. 4. In this Order  pursuant to section 49(7)(d) of the Financial Markets Authority Act 2011  associated person has the same meaning as section 6(1) of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013  with the full meaning being set out in section 12 of that Act.Note that a person who contravenes an Order made by&nbsp;us under Section 49 of the Financial Markets Authority Act 2011 commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding $300 000.This Order is made subject to any further Orders by us.COPY OF ORDER: General Equity: Warning Disclosure Order under Section 49 of the Financial Markets Authority Act 2011REASONS FOR MAKING THE ORDER: Following issue of the warning about General Equity we made an Order under section 49(1) of the Financial Markets Authority Act 2011 against General Equity and associated persons of General Equity  requiring them to prominently disclose a copy of the warning on 1 or more Internet sites maintained by or on behalf of the those persons (a warning disclosure order).&nbsp;We made the warning disclosure order for the following reasons: It is important that those dealing with General Equity are made aware of&nbsp;our concerns as expressed in the warning. A disclosure order under section 49 ensures that the warning is disseminated directly by General Equity  which will result in a wider and more targeted and relevant distribution than might otherwise be the case if&nbsp;we relied solely on publishing the warning on the&nbsp;our website.

"Phoenix Forex Limited",29/08/2013,"Company: Phoenix Forex Limited\nCity: \nFSPR: \nADDRESS:&nbsp;Level 2  14 Viaduct Harbour Avenue  Auckland.REASON FOR WARNING:&nbsp;We believe that Phoenix Forex’s claims about the level of returns made by&nbsp;the Oak FX foreign exchange&nbsp;trading system are untrue  and that Phoenix Forex is misrepresenting the profitability of  and risks associated with  its trading system. Investments promising unusually high returns are often not legitimate offers.&nbsp;We urge caution by anyone considering dealing with Phoenix Forex.OTHER INFORMATION:&nbsp;Phoenix Forex is providing access to a foreign exchange trading system. Under this system  the investor opens an account with a third party broker and the investor’s account is traded for the investor using algorithmic trading software. Phoenix Forex undertakes extensive advertising  as well as making unsolicited cold-calls to potential investors.&nbsp;We understand Phoenix Forex requires investors to pay a substantial up-front fee of up to $25 700 to subscribe for the system.Phoenix Forex has previously advertised returns of between 50% to 65% per annum  and continues to promote the trading system as providing high returns. In&nbsp;our experience  it is highly unlikely that this kind of investment can deliver such high returns. Phoenix Forex has not been able to provide any evidence to support its claims of having achieved these returns. Further  investments of this nature carry a high risk of loss of some or all of an investor’s capital  and losses can exceed the amount of the original investment.In addition  any person who is in the business of providing financial services must be registered on the Financial Service Provides Register. Further  a company which is in the business of dealing in futures contracts  including margin foreign exchange products  must be authorised by FMA. Phoenix Forex is not registered as a financial service provider  and has not been authorised or licensed by FMA for any service.Prospective investors should check to confirm a person or company is registered  and do their own due diligence on that person or company  before engaging any financial service provider or paying any money in respect of a financial service or investment. Any investor who is unsure about a financial service provider or a financial product should seek independent financial advice from a registered or authorised financial adviser before making any investment.Warning Disclosure Order under Section 49 of the FMA Act 2011&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,"Suspected scam"

The scammers get the numbers from publicly available shareholder lists  making their approach all the more plausible.It's the latest warning from a cross-agency working group  made up of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs  Department of Internal Affairs and Netsafe. The group is dedicated to fighting consumer fraud.The boiler room scammers persuade their victims to sell underperforming shares in their portfolios. The scammers send legitimate-looking payment instructions  refund documents offering 'protection' if the sale falls through and have created a clone website of the actual company.This type of fraud − sometimes known as a boiler room scam  referring to the boiler rooms from which the fraudsters typically operate − is usually a slick operation.""The callers are very clever and persuasive "" says Ministry of Consumer Affairs Team Leader Jarrod Rendle. ""They make offers that are very hard to resist. Add to that an impressive website and documentation that appears genuine and even the most seasoned investor is at risk of being taken in.""The Financial Markets Authority advises the safest way to buy shares in overseas companies is through a registered New Zealand broker  who is responsible under New Zealand law.

"SuperLife Limited and SuperLife Trustees Limited",21/06/2011,"Company: SuperLife Limited and SuperLife Trustees Limited\nCity: \nFSPR: \nASSOCIATED PERSON: Patrick DiackREASON FOR WARNING:&nbsp;We are seriously concerned about SuperLife's sales practices and potential non-compliance with the law.We have&nbsp;issued a warning to SuperLife Limited and SuperLife Trustees Limited (together 'SuperLife') to overhaul its KiwiSaver sales practices.FMA Chief Executive Sean Hughes said we are seriously concerned about a number of matters regarding SuperLife's sales practices  potential non-compliance with the law and apparent poor monitoring of the activities of its sales force. Hughes stated ""from 1 July  FMA will monitor compliance by KiwiSaver providers with their obligations under the Financial Advisers Act.&nbsp;We will not hesitate to take enforcement action against KiwiSaver providers who fail to ensure they comply with their legal requirements.""&nbsp;On 9 June 2011 &nbsp;we urged investors to be wary of unacceptable sales practices being used by unregistered KiwiSaver sales representative Patrick Diack. Mr Diack's sales approaches included soliciting members of the public outside WINZ offices  offering them money to join a KiwiSaver scheme and signing them up to scheme membership without providing them with the investment statement - which is the disclosure document that provides investors with the information they need to make an informed decision.We are&nbsp;also concerned about the distribution practices of the SuperLife KiwiSaver Scheme represented by Mr Diack.&nbsp;Particular concerns related to SuperLife's apparent failure to properly train its employees and monitor their compliance with the requirements of laws including the Securities Act and Financial Service Providers (Registration and Dispute Resolution) Act.After ongoing discussions with SuperLife &nbsp;we continue to be particularly concerned that SuperLife: failed to ensure that its employees giving advice  such as Mr Diack  are registered on the Financial Service Providers Register as required from 31 March this year failed to rigorously train and test its employees in relation to the requirements of law failed to adequately monitor its employees' performance and to performance manage any employees who fell short of the standard required. We have&nbsp;warned SuperLife  and now emphasises to all KiwiSaver providers that: door-to-door selling of securities is illegal under the Securities Act any form of high pressure  coercive or misleading selling is inappropriate for KiwiSaver schemes We expect that before an application for membership of a scheme is accepted  the issuer will have taken reasonable steps to satisfy itself the applicant is aware of the nature and extent of the obligations they are incurring and has made the decision freely and on a properly informed basis KiwiSaver providers must comply with the Financial Advisers Act and Financial Service Providers (Registration and Dispute Resolution) Act and be aware of their effect on the requirements for distribution of their products. We are&nbsp;further concerned that SuperLife intends to continue distributing the SuperLife KiwiSaver Scheme without ensuring its representatives are Authorised Financial Advisers or QFE advisers as required by the Financial Advisers Act.&nbsp;We understand SuperLife is doing this on the basis that its employees are providing an 'information only' service.&nbsp;Mr Hughes said that the provision of factual information may amount to financial advice depending on the context  stating&nbsp;""the potential investor's expectation of the service  and the context in which those services are provided  need to be carefully considered.&nbsp;A person gives 'financial advice' if he or she makes a recommendation or gives an opinion in relation to acquiring or disposing of a financial product.&nbsp;This definition is very broad. While the Financial Advisers Act does contain some exemptions and exceptions  these are limited in their application and will be carefully interpreted with Parliament's intention in mind. We believe it is unlikely that a person presenting the merits of a particular KiwiSaver scheme to a person  in a workplace context or otherwise  will not give financial advice in the course of his or her discussions with a prospective member.""Mr Hughes said&nbsp;we encourage all KiwiSaver providers to ensure their sales representatives are appropriately authorised.Investors who want to receive advice on what type of KiwiSaver investment is right for them should ask for personalised advice from an AFA or a QFE adviser.&nbsp;Contact: Roger Marwick 04 471 7659 or Carole van Grondelle 04 474 2066",,,,,,,,,,
"Bernard Whimp",02/05/2011,"Company: Bernard Whimp\nCity: \nFSPR: \nREASON FOR WARNING:&nbsp; Offers from Mr Bernard Whimp may not be in your best interests.OTHER INFORMATION:&nbsp;We&nbsp;urge you to treat this offer with great caution.Before you accept it  carefully read the details of what you will be paid and when  and any fine print anywhere on the offer or forms.We&nbsp;consider it is not in your interests to accept an offer that is for less than the market price  or where you will have to wait longer than three days to be paid.Make an informed decision - seek advice from a registered financial adviser  your lawyer  your accountant  a Community Law Centre or Citizen's Advice Bureau.Even if you've been asked to respond urgently  take the time to make a few important checks: How much will you receive per share?&nbsp;Check the most recent market price for your shares and compare it with the price you are being offered. For listed companies  the most recent price is available on the&nbsp;NZX website&nbsp;and in newspapers. If your investment isn't traded on any organised market  find out how much it is likely to be worth from a registered financial adviser. When will you get paid?&nbsp;Make sure you understand when and how you will get paid. It may be that you won't get paid for some time after you've handed over your shares. Payment may be made in instalments  rather than in a lump sum  and these payments may be spread over many years - possibly ten or fifteen years. Who is making the offer?&nbsp;The offer may have come from an entity associated with Mr Whimp that has little or no assets. If you accept it  you will be trusting a stranger with no known financial substance to pay you for your shares when they say they will. Check who you are dealing with  and consider whether they are trustworthy and likely to pay. We&nbsp;specifically warn you that if you sell your shares by accepting this offer  you risk selling them for less than you would get by selling them through a sharebroker.If you sell shares through a sharebroker you will receive the full market price for your shares (less any brokerage fees) and you are likely to receive payment within 3 days. You can find a sharebroker in the Yellow® Pages under&nbsp;""sharebroker""  on the NZX website  or by talking to a registered financial adviser.12 April 2011Shareholders in several listed companies have complained to the Securities Commission about offers made in March 2011 from limited partnerships associated with Mr Bernard Whimp. Shareholders are concerned that Mr Whimp's offers may be misleading. So are we.Which offers?The offers were made around 15-18 March 2011 by: Carrington Securities LP - to buy shares in TrustPower Limited NZ Investment Securities LP - to buy shares in Vector Limited Chase Securities LP - to buy shares in Guinness Peat Group plc Carlyle Securities LP - to buy shares in Contact Energy Limited Energy Securities LP - to buy shares in DNZ Property Fund Limited Fairfield Securities LP - to buy shares in Fletcher Building Limited. Mr Whimp is the general partner of all these limited partnerships.What has the Securities Commission done about the offers?We have obtained interim orders that stop the transfer of shares to the buyers until the Court decides whether the offers are misleading.What happens next?The Court will decide on 9 May 2011 if the offers are misleading. I accepted an offer - what should I do now? You don't have to do anything at the moment. You can go to our website at www.seccom.govt.nz for more information  and watch the media for the outcome of the hearing. If the Court decides the offers were misleading  the Securities Commission will ask it to cancel the share sales and for any shares already sold to be returned. If the Court decides the offers weren't misleading  the accepted offers will go through and shares will be transferred. You may have had a notice from us or be about to get one. This explains that you may go ahead and sell your shares regardless of what the Court decides about the offers. DO NOT SIGN&nbsp;and return the notice&nbsp;UNLESS&nbsp;you do want to go ahead and sell your shares to the limited partnership that offered to buy them. What shall I do if the Court decides the offers weren't misleading?We recommend you get legal advice as soon as possible. The Court may decide the offers were not misleading  and/or the Commission might be unable to cancel the sale of shares and have them returned to you.We can't give you any legal advice. A lawyer will be able to tell you what your other options are.How did the partnerships get hold of information about me?Companies are legally required to provide a copy of their share registers to anyone who asks for it. This includes the names and addresses of their shareholders.Are these offers illegal?It's not illegal to offer to buy someone's shares or to offer to buy them at below their current market value. But it is against the law to mislead or deceive someone into accepting an offer.At first sight  these offers seem to be for above the shares' current market value  but we believe they are misleading. You won't be fully paid for 10 years so  in today's value  the offer is worth much less than first appears.Not only is the offer worth less than it appears  but it's worth less than you would get if you sold your shares now at the current price through a sharebroker.You will also lose rights to any dividends over those 10 years  and you will have to trust the creditworthiness of the limited partnership to meet your ongoing payments.Where can I get more information?Go to www.seccom.govt.nz. Or you can call the registrar of the company you hold shares in - Computershare Investor Services Limited - on 0800 888 726.File Attachments Recent offers by limited partnerships associated with Mr Bernard Whimp to purchase shares (38 kB pdf) Related""Low ball"" offers - guidance for investorsMedia release: Whimp partnerships injuncted at Securities Commission's request&nbsp;Media release: Securities Commission orders Whimp partnerships to correct 'low ball' offers&nbsp;Media release: Commission warns about more unsolicited offers&nbsp;Commission issues warning on unsolicited offers from Carrington Securities and Energy Securities LP&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,

"NZ Investment Securities LP (NZIS)",28/04/2011,"Company: NZ Investment Securities LP (NZIS)\nCity: \nFSPR: \nWARNING: Unsolicited offer for Sky City Entertainment Group Limited Shares and further expected unsolicited offers.REASON FOR WARNING: Shareholders in Sky City Entertainment Group Limited should be wary of an offer dated 18 April 2011 from NZ Investment Securities LP (NZIS) to buy their shares for $2.30 per share.The general partner of NZ Investment Securities LP is Mr Bernard Whimp. The Commission is currently taking legal proceedings against NZ Investment Securities LP and other limited partnerships associated with Mr Whimp. The Commission considers that it cannot be in a shareholder's interests to accept the offer for the following reasons.The amount offered per share is less than the current market price of the shares. The most recent market price for the shares is available on the NZX website at&nbsp;www.nzx.com. At 11.00am on 20 April 2011  the market price was $3.39 per share.If a shareholder instead sold their shares through a broker  they would receive the full market price (less any fees payable).That means that any shareholder who sold their shares to NZIS today would lose around $1 per share - or around a third of their shares' value.In addition  payment for the shares will not be made until up to 14 days after NZIS has received notification from the share registry that the shares have been transferred. It is therefore likely that shareholders will not receive payment for shares sold under the offer for at least 3 weeks after they accept it.If a shareholder instead sold their shares through a broker  they would likely receive payment within 3 working days. The offers suggest that there is an urgent need for investors to act on the offers. The Commission is not aware of any such urgency.It is not illegal to make an unsolicited offer to buy investments or to offer to buy them at a price below their current market value. However it is against the law to mislead or deceive investors into accepting an offer.The Commission is aware that Mr Whimp  and some other people  have recently requested the share registers of a number of other listed companies and is concerned that other unsolicited offers may be made in the coming weeks.Any investor who receives an unsolicited offer is encouraged to treat such an offer with great caution  to carefully read the offer in full including any fine print anywhere on the forms  and to take the time to make a few important checks.Contact: Rebecca Barclay 04 471 7666",,,,,,,,,,"Suspected scam"

" Carrington Securities LP",10/08/2010,"Company:  Carrington Securities LP\nCity: \nFSPR: \nDATE: 10 August 2010WARNING: Unsolicited Offer for DNZ Property Fund Limited SharesShareholders in DNZ Property Fund Limited should be wary of an offer by Carrington Securities LP to buy their shares for $0.60 per share.The Securities Commission reminds investors to be cautious of any unsolicited offer to purchase their investments and urges investors to seek professional advice before making any decision to accept the offer.As the shares are not currently trading on any organised market  there is no market price against which investors can assess the offer and accordingly  it is very difficult to accurately assess the value of the company's shares. Shareholders should consider  together with other relevant factors  the indicative price range of $0.80 to $1.05 per shares which is set out in DNZ Property Fund Limited's prospectus.Under securities legislation it is not illegal to offer to buy securities below their face value. Any offer to buy securities from investors must not be misleading or deceptive.The general partner of Carrington Securities LP is Mr Bernard Whimp.DATE: 16 March 2011Commission Issues Warning on Unsolicited Offers from Carrington Securities and Energy Securities LPThe Securities Commission is warning investors to be very wary of any unexpected offers they may receive for their shares or other investments.Over the past week  the Commission has become aware of a number of unsolicited offers  including for TrustPower shares and for units in the DNZ Property Fund.The offers have been made by limited partnerships  Carrington Securities and Energy Securities LP of which Bernard Whimp is general partner.Unlike earlier unsolicited offers on which the Commission has issued warnings  these offers are made at prices that appear at first sight to be above their market value. However  payment for the shares or units is deferred and wouldn't be received by the investor in full for as long as 10 years - with yearly payments being made in instalments of only a few cents a year per share.This means that the offers are worth significantly less than may appear at first sight and may even mean that the investor will never receive the full payment if the offeror is unable or unwilling to pay at any time in the future.The Commission has also been informed that requests have been made by Mr Whimp for copies of the share registers of a significant number of New Zealand listed companies and suspects that a large number of investors may soon receive unexpected offers for their investments.Commission Chairman  Jane Diplock said ""We strongly recommend that any investor who receives an unexpected offer to buy their investments takes the time to check they understand a few simple facts about the offer - including both how the price being offered compares with the market price and also when the purchase price is payable - and to seek advice and support from another person. Ideally a reputable financial adviser  but talking with the Citizens Advice Bureau or even family and friends can be a good start.""While it is not illegal to make an unsolicited offer to buy investments  it is against the law to mislead or deceive investors into accepting an offer and the Commission is urgently reviewing the current offers in light of that requirement.&nbsp;",,,,,,,,,,"Suspected scam"
"Stock & Share Trading Company Pty Limited",06/05/2010,"Company: Stock & Share Trading Company Pty Limited\nCity: \nFSPR: \nADDRESS:&nbsp;AustraliaREASON FOR WARNING: Multiple unsolicited offers.OTHER INFORMATION: We are&nbsp;reminding investors to be wary of unsolicited offers being made by Stock &amp; Share Trading Company Pty Limited for shares and other securities. Stock &amp; Share's offers are often for significantly less than the market value of the securities.Stock &amp; Share has regularly been making unsolicited offers and continues to do so.&nbsp;We are aware of two current offers by Stock &amp; Share  one for certain capital notes issued by Fletcher Building Industries Limited and the other for shares in TOWER Limited. Stock &amp; Share has also recently requested registers of security holders from a number of other entities  including ASB NZ Property Trust  so it is likely that it will be making further unsolicited offers.Since October last year  Stock &amp; Share has been required to carry an FMA warning statement on any unsolicited offers it makes  pursuant to an enforceable undertaking provided to FMA. The warning statement encourages investors to make informed decisions by recommending that they talk to an Authorised Financial Adviser (AFA) about what their investment is really worth and by disclosing the market price of the securities  or alternative pricing information if the securities are not listed.FMA also advises investors that VonWin Capital Management L.P. intends to make an offer to the bondholders of Irongate Property Limited (In Receivership) who have expressed an interest in selling their bonds.FMA has also asked that VonWin Capital Management include a warning in any offer they send to Irongate bondholders.UPDATED: 3 September 2012  21 December 2011  8 July 2011The Financial Markets Authority urges you to treat this offer with great caution.Before you accept it  carefully read the details of what you will be paid and when  and any fine print anywhere on the offer or forms.Make an informed decision - seek advice from an authorised financial adviser  a Community Law Centre  or Citizen's Advice Bureau.Even if you've been asked to respond urgently  take the time to make a few important checks: How much will you receive for your investment?&nbsp;Check the most recent market price for your investment and compare it with the price you are being offered. For listed companies  the most recent price is available on the NZX website&nbsp;www.nzx.com&nbsp;and in newspapers. If your investment isn't traded on any organised market (for example because it is an interest in a failed finance company)  find out how much it is likely to be worth from a authorised financial adviser  the company that offers the investment  or (if the company you invested in is in receivership) from the receivers.&nbsp; Receivers reports can give a good indication of how much you are likely to receive for your investment.&nbsp; You can find copies of the receivers reports by searching under the companies name on the Companies Office website&nbsp;www.companies.govt.nz. When will you get paid?&nbsp;Make sure you understand when and how you will get paid. It may be that you won't get paid for some time after you've handed over your investment. Who is making the offer?&nbsp;Check who you are dealing with  and consider whether they are trustworthy and likely to pay you. The Financial Markets Authority regulates New Zealand's financial markets. Our main objective is to promote fair  efficient and transparent financial markets.
