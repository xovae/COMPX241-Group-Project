    "Description": "nThe FMA is concerned about a number of IPO (Initial Public Offering) websites which claim to alert investors of upcoming share buying opportunities before they go public (Pre-IPO). Many of these websites refer to an upcoming IPO for the satellite internet company Starlink. We may continue to add further websites to this warning as we become aware of them. How the scam works These websites claim to help investors get early access to IPO investment opportunities. They may also claim to provide \u201ctop picks\u201d of upcoming IPOs  or market trends and insights. Site users are prompted to enter personal contact details and proposed investments into an online form. They are then told they will be emailed \u201calerts\u201d about new IPOs  or be called by a representative. Investors are then either convinced via email or telephone to invest  often being told that this is a \u2018limited opportunity\u2019  or that the price of shares will soon rise quickly.&nbsp; The investor will be asked to fill out application forms and provide identity documents such as a passport to open an account and satisfy relevant \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d requirements.&nbsp; The scammers email a Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) which does not meet the FMA\u2019s requirements for PDS \u2013 for more information on PDS scams see the article: How to identify a product disclosure statement (PDS) or prospectus scam. The investor will then be instructed to transfer their funds to a bank account or via cryptocurrency. Being asked to pay for shares via cryptocurrency is a red flag. Often the victim only becomes aware they are part of a scam when the news of the impending IPO is never announced  their broker stops answering emails or they try to withdraw their investment. &nbsp; For more information on IPO\u2019s and how they work see our article Spotlight on: IPOs.&nbsp; You can also read a real life case study of a New Zealander who narrowly avoided being scammed in a fake Starlink IPO investment: Starlink fraud case study. &nbsp; Contacts to be wary of",

    "Description": "nWe are concerned that Ashbourne Wealth Management may be operating a scam. Ashbourne Wealth Management is a fake online investment platform  which tricks investors into laundering fraudulent funds. How the scam works Ashbourne Wealth Management posts advertisements on social media  encouraging victims to invest. The victim\u2019s small initial investment quickly grows to large profits. Ashbourne Wealth Management tells the victim they will need to pay a large upfront fee to withdraw their profits. When the victim is unable or unwilling to pay  Ashbourne Wealth Management offers to pay the fees for the victim. The victim receives funds into their bank account from a third party who is the victim of a recovery room scam. The victim is then instructed to forward the funds received to Ashbourne Wealth Management to pay for the withdrawal fees. The victim has unknowingly become a money mule for Ashbourne Wealth Management. We recommend caution when dealing with any person or entity that operates the same or similar ways described above. If a person or entity asks you to receive funds and instructs you to pay them on to a third party  exercise extreme caution. These are warning signs that the entity may be operating a money mule scam. Ashbourne Wealth Management is not registered to provide financial services in New Zealand. Always check whether a financial service provider is registered on the Financial Service Providers Register (FSPR) before accepting an offer of financial services.",

Bit Pro Gain says it is offering an online trading platform but is operating an investment scam.&nbsp; We have received a report from a New Zealand investor who created an account with Bit Pro Gain through the website bitprogain.io  and began with a small credit card payment to the platform. The investor says that Bit Pro Gain then took several unauthorised payments from the investor\u2019s bank account  totalling more than $250 000.&nbsp; Scam uses remote access software to access financial information When an investor creates a new account with Bit Pro Gain  they are prompted to install an app on their phone. Users are told the app will let them receive notifications about their investments. However  the app is a remote access application  which can grant Bit Pro Gain access to notifications and messages from the user\u2019s phone and other devices. Bit Pro Gain may be able to use this access to receive users\u2019 banking information or 2 factor authentication codes. Bit Pro Gain is operating through multiple websites We have concerns that bitpro-gain.com may be associated with the same investment scam  as the website offers similar services to bitprogain.io and uses the name Bit Pro-Gain. The website also displays a doctored version of a New Zealand Certificate of Incorporation.&nbsp; The Alberta Securities Commission has published a warning about the website bitprogain.com  which Bit Pro Gain has previously used to promote this scam. View the Alberta Securities Commission\u2019s warning about bitprogain.com This warning may be updated in future  if the FMA becomes aware of other Bit Pro Gain websites or contact channels. &nbsp;",

The FMA reminds the public to always use the Financial Service Provider Register (FSPR) to check if a trading platform is registered to provide financial products and services to New Zealand. View the Financial Service Providers Register (FSPR) How the scam works The scammers post videos on YouTube or other social media platforms offering crypto \u201ctips\u201d and trading advice. These YouTube channels invite viewers to join private WhatsApp or Telegram groups for discussions on crypto investments. Prize offers and gifts are used to encourage viewers to join up. Scammers may also encourage viewers to comment on their videos. This can give the scammers access to viewers\u2019 contact details  which then lets the scammers approach viewers directly via WhatsApp or Telegram. Once the user has accepted a WhatsApp or Telegram invite  scammers present themselves as an investment \u2018expert\u2019  \u2018mentor\u2019 or \u2018coach\u2019  and start offering investment advice. The scammer will make unrealistic promises about these crypto investments  for example \u201cearn above $2000 - $7000 daily on crypto\u201d or \u201cavoid risks and generate profit... within three days\u201d. The scammer will introduce the user to a fake investment platform. These fake platforms may imitate well-known cryptocurrency exchanges. The scammer will then coach the user through investing. Often  they will first encourage their victim to invest a small amount of money. They are then told they\u2019ve earned big profits and encouraged to invest even more money. When the victim asks to withdraw their funds  they are told they must first pay a fee to release the money; even if these fees are paid  no money is paid out. If you come across these videos  or investment platforms like this  or you\u2019re added to unknown group chats  don\u2019t engage with them and don\u2019t give out any personal information or identity documents. View our warning about an earlier version of this scam  which used ads on social media platforms to link customers to WhatsApp groups. What to do if you think you have been scammed Stop all contact with the scammer and don\u2019t send any money. Report the videos to YouTube  report any advice&nbsp;groups to WhatsApp or Telegram  and block the scammer on all your devices. Contact your bank immediately. Ask if a transaction reversal is possible. If you sent money using another payment service provider  ask them to trace the funds. If you are getting spam emails and text messages  report these to the&nbsp;Department of Internal Affairs. Tell a trusted relative or friend what has happened. They may help you see the situation more clearly  help you deal with the scammers  and suggest what to do next.

We have seen similar scams in the past involving the use of well-known investment firms in the offer of fake bonds and other fixed term deposit products in the name of Heartland Bank  as well as a number of other New Zealand and overseas banks. Please see our past warnings about these scams: Heartland Bank - Fake term deposits and bonds HSBC - Fake term deposits Kiwibank - Comparison website harvesting investor details Rates Finder - Comparison website harvesting investor details How the scam works The victim sees an advertisement or visits an invest comparison website (like comparetermdepositsnz.com)  where they are prompted to enter their contact details. The victim receives a call from someone claiming to be an investment adviser from a well-known New Zealand firm. The \u2018investment adviser\u2019 will speak to the victim about an investment opportunity  usually with a well-known New Zealand bank or investment firm. The adviser may provide detailed but fraudulent investment documentation to the victim while attempting to persuade them to invest. Once the victim makes their investment  the scammer ceases contact  and the funds are lost. Website redirection service may also be used to redirect people to the official website of an organisation to mislead people into thinking that the scam website is legitimate. We recommend caution when dealing with people who claim to be from well-known investment management firms  especially after you enter your personal details in deposit comparison websites such as comparetermdepositsnz.com. Investors should conduct due diligence checks by contacting the investment firm or financial institution the caller claims to represent  to verify their identity before investing. Make sure you do not&nbsp;use the contact information provided by the caller. Instead  use the contact information listed on their official website.",

Users are then prompted to join a WhatsApp group after clicking the ad. Alternatively  the scammer may add phone numbers directly to a WhatsApp group  without the user interacting with an ad first. The WhatsApp group is led by someone described as a \u201cmentor  \u201ccoach\u201d \u201cprofessor\u201d or \u201cassistant\u201d. The groups promise unrealistic returns such as turning $100k into $10m within 6-12 months  with their help. Gift cards  credit or free trades might be provided for attending sessions or completing educational training courses. The mentor will introduce and recommend an investment platform to the victim. Scammers have gone to great lengths to make these online platforms appear authentic. The investment platform will message users  helping them set up an account and make transfers. The user will then be able to make several trades  believing the platform to be authentic  which encourages them to invest more money. When the victim asks to withdraw funds  they are told they must first pay a fee to release the money; even if these fees are paid  no money is paid out. If you come across these ads or investment platforms  do not click on them and don't give them your personal information or identity documents. Learn more about Investment software packages and seminars What to do if you think you have been scammed Stop all contact with the scammer and do not send any money. Report the group to WhatsApp and block the scammer on all devices. Contact your bank immediately. Ask if a transaction reversal is possible. If you sent money using another payment service provider  ask them to trace the funds. If you are getting spam emails and text messages  report these to the Department of Internal Affairs. Tell a trusted relative or friend what has happened. They may help you see the situation more clearly  help you deal with the scammers  and suggest what to do next.

    "Name": "Deepfake video scam warning: fake news stories, political endorsements - multiple trading platforms",
    "Date": "06/08/2024",
    "Description": "nThe FMA has received several reports about a scam using fake endorsements supposedly coming from New Zealand politicians. Their names and images are being faked and misused to promote online investment schemes. This scam uses fake news stories  spread through multiple websites and advertisements  with the names of investment schemes and websites used to promote the scam changing frequently. Updated 9 October 2024 The FMA is aware that this scam is now using fake news articles featuring claims that New Zealanders will receive \u201cincome\u201d or \u201cdividend\u201d payments from IRD. The fake claims say that money will be sent to New Zealanders after they sign up with an online investment platform. These fake news articles include photographs of New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and other New Zealand politicians and feature headlines such as: \u201cBy the order of Christopher Luxon  New Zealand residents will start receiving income from taxes.\u201d Inland Revenue has confirmed these claims are false. There is no pool of tax funds becoming available for distribution to New Zealanders. How the scam works Scammers draw in victims through advertisements placed on social media platforms and news aggregators. There are several variations of these advertisements. Some ads: Show an image of a politician next to a fictional quote about a new investment opportunity e.g.  \"According to Christopher Luxon  all citizens of New Zealand can officially retire at the age of 45!\" Contain generic images  with a headline designed to promote fear about the stability of New Zealand pensions e.g.  \"PENSION PAYMENTS WILL BE CANCELLED IN THE NEW ZEALAND!\". Feature deepfake videos of politicians  including New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters. These fake videos show the politician being interviewed about a new investment opportunity which they have invested in personally  or which is claimed to be endorsed by the government. These advertisements link to fake news articles featuring false quotes and endorsements from politicians  usually promoting an investment platform. These articles are often made to appear as though they are being published by legitimate New Zealand media organisations. These fake news articles have links to other websites  advertising investment platforms or promoting educational materials about investments. The websites include registration forms  where potential victims are prompted to enter their contact details. Scammers will then contact the victim claiming to be an investment broker and give instructions for investing through the platform. Victims are encouraged to make a small investment at first (around US$250/NZ$420). Requests for larger investments will likely follow. &nbsp; Exercise caution The FMA recommends extreme caution when engaging with social media advertisements or links in news aggregators that include fake political endorsements promoting investment opportunities. Do not click on these ads or links  and do not enter your personal information into these websites. If you have been contacted by a scammer after entering your personal information into one of these websites  do not make any payments or transfer any money to the scammers. Related warning View Fake celebrity investment scam - multiple platforms What to do if you think you have been scammed? Contact your bank immediately. Ask if a transaction reversal is possible. If you sent money using another payments service provider  ask them to trace the funds.

If you have accessed your bank account or other payment systems while the remote access software was operating on your device  report this to the relevant account providers.

    "Date": "13/05/2024",
    "Description": "nThe FMA has received several reports regarding fake celebrity endorsement advertisements on social media  promoting online investment schemes. We have identified multiple websites that are part of this scam but believe there may be more connected as they frequently change. We are aware of several New Zealanders who have invested through these websites and are now unable to withdraw funds  with additional fees requested before allowing withdrawals.&nbsp; How the scam works: The scammer creates an advertisement on a social media platform featuring a deepfake video of an interview with a celebrity or a fake news article  appearing to be from a reputable New Zealand media platform. The ad usually includes the image of a New Zealand celebrity with an attention-grabbing headline. The ad does not at first glance appear to be about investing. Clicking on this ad leads to a fake news article on an imposter website designed to look like a reputable New Zealand news platform. This article describes an interview with the celebrity where they discuss making big profits using a certain investment platform.&nbsp; The article contains a link to the website of an investment platform \u2013 often trading cryptocurrencies or foreign exchange \u2013 where people are asked to register for an account and provide contact details. &nbsp;&nbsp; After providing this information  a call is received from someone claiming to be a broker or a financial adviser instructing the person to make a payment of $250 USD or \u20ac250.&nbsp; They may instruct the person to download remote access software such as \u201cAnyDesk\u201d so the fake adviser can \u201chelp\u201d with the investments. The scammer will transfer \u201cprofits\u201d to the victim\u2019s bank account giving a false impression of legitimacy.&nbsp; Instructions are then made to make higher investments  and dashboards are provided tracking these apparent investments. When the victim asks to withdraw funds  they are told they must first pay a high fee to release the money. But even if these fees are paid  no money is returned. The FMA recommends extreme caution when engaging with social media advertising using the image of celebrities to promote investment opportunities. &nbsp; If you come across these ads  do not click on them and don\u2019t give them your personal information. &nbsp; What to do if you think you have been scammed: Stop all contact with the scammer and do not send any money. Contact your bank immediately. Ask if a transaction reversal is possible. If you sent money using another payment service provider  ask them to trace the funds. &nbsp; If you have downloaded remote access software on the instructions of the scammers  immediately contact an IT professional to have your device checked for malware. If you have accessed your bank account or other payment systems while the remote access software was operating on your device  report this to the relevant account providers. &nbsp; If you keep getting phone calls from scammers  report them to your telecommunications provider. &nbsp; If you are getting spam emails and text messages  report these to the Department of Internal Affairs here: Spam-Report-Spam - dia.govt.nz.&nbsp; Tell a trusted relative or friend what has happened. They may help you see the situation more clearly  help you deal with the scammers  and suggest what to do next.&nbsp; Contact Victim Support\u202fon 0800 842 846 or\u202fvisit their website.

The relevant facts are as follows: In October 2013  Pacific Edge Diagnostics USA  a subsidiary of Pacific Edge  entered into agreements with two organisations based in the United States of America  FedMed and American\u2019s Choice Provider Network (ACPN) under which those organisations agreed to provide access to their respective national provider network in the United States of America for PEB\u2019s CxBladder product. PEB disclosed to NZX Limited (NZX) the signing of each agreement some days after the relevant agreement was signed. In the period between signing and disclosure to NZX  PEB was seeking approval from the contractual counterparty to announce the signing of the agreement. Following the announcement of each agreement the price in PEB\u2019s shares increased. The FMA considers that the execution of the ACPN and FedMed agreements amounted to material information and that consequently Pacific Edge ought to have disclosed the signing of each agreement to the NZX immediately upon execution of the",

    "Date": "23/10/2014",
    "Description": "nThe Financial Markets Authority (FMA) is warning New Zealand consumers and investors to be wary of cold-calls asking them to buy shares or put their money into offshore firms. The FMA is receiving an increasing number of complaints about suspicious offers that involve transferring funds overseas. The flow of complaints relates to firms or people making cold-calls and offering suspicious \u2018big win\u2019 products or services  including investment schemes and forex trading services. The FMA\u2019s Director of Compliance  Elaine Campbell  said today\u2019s warning is targeted at cold-calling \u2018big win\u2019 scams  most often from overseas or unknown locations. \u201cThere are some tell-tale signs to beware of that should cause consumers to take extra caution.\u201d&nbsp; These include: Requests to transfer funds overseas quickly to the account of a firm or person. Claims you must \u2018act now or miss out\u2019  putting your money in now to enjoy a big payoff. Discouraging or prohibiting customers from seeking independent professional advice about the product  service  or transaction. Offers involving software or so-called \u201ctrading systems\u201d \u2013 often for forex trading \u2013 where consumers must buy a license or software  in order to participate. Ms Campbell said  \u201cThere\u2019s one principle to keep in mind: if an offer sounds too good to be true  then it probably is. Our advice is simple. Don\u2019t transfer funds offshore to firms  or people  making offers like this \u2013 hang up the phone.&nbsp; If you don\u2019t understand an investment or product  don\u2019t put your money in.\u201d \u201cTransferring funds offshore \u2013 especially to firms that you don\u2019t recognise or can\u2019t fully verify \u2013 adds unnecessary risk for consumers. &nbsp;Generally  the FMA cannot help consumers to recover funds once they have transferred sums offshore.\u201c The FMA is aware of firms providing fake website URLs that appear to be for a big-brand firm. The FMA publishes names of firms and people where it has identified an entity or a person who is operating without registration or authorisation in New Zealand  or where the firm or person is not complying with New Zealand\u2019s financial services law. There is also a similar international list on FMA\u2019s website provided by the&nbsp;International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). &nbsp;However  even where names or firms of cold-callers do not appear on these lists  consumers should not assume they are operating legitimately. Ms Campbell said checking that firms are licensed or regulated in other countries could help consumers verify that such a firm exists. \u201cBut the fact that a firm is licensed or registered is not a guarantee for your money \u201d she said. Ms Campbell said consumers could use resources provided by the FMA and Consumer Affairs New Zealand that are designed to alert people to common characteristics of dubious offers. \u201cConsumers don\u2019t need to be drawn into these dubious offers. They can participate in well-regulated  genuine offers made by firms operating in New Zealand. &nbsp;There is plenty of choice in investment and financial services products that are provided by reliable firms and professionals. \u201cGenuine financial products and services offer consumers the protection of New Zealand law. All financial services products and securities contain some element of risk  so it\u2019s a good idea to seek some professional advice.\u201d Links to regulator and consumer websites in New Zealand: http://",
